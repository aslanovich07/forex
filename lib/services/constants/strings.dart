At that time, some unnamed printer created a large collection of font sizes and shapes, using Lorem Ipsum to print samples. 

Lorem Ipsum has not only successfully survived five centuries without noticeable change, but has also crossed over into electronic design. It was popularized in the new age by the publication of Letraset sheets with Lorem Ipsum samples in the 1960s and, more recently, by electronic layout programs like Aldus PageMaker, whose templates use Lorem Ipsum.

Many people think that Lorem Ipsum is a pseudo-Latin set of words taken from the ceiling, but that's not quite true. It has its roots in a single fragment of Classical Latin from 45 AD, that is, more than two millennia ago.""";
